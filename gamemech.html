            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed and published by Valve. The game is a sequel to Defense of the Ancients (DotA), which was a community-created mod for Blizzard Entertainment's Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos. Dota 2 is played in matches between two teams of five players, with each team occupying and defending their own separate base on the map. Each of the ten players independently controls a powerful character, known as a "hero", who all have unique abilities and differing styles of play. During a match players collect experience points and items for their heroes to successfully defeat the opposing team's heroes in player versus player combat. A team wins by being the first to destroy the other team's "Ancient", a large structure located within their base.</p>

        <div id="map">
            <h1>Map</h1>
            <div>
                <h3>Lanes</h3>
                <p>Each lane has three towers, which have to be taken down before the vital barracks can be destroyed. In the base you can find the main shop, in the jungle, the secret shop and dependent on the map version also side shop exists.</p>
            </div>
    
            <div>
                <h3>Bounty Runes</h3>
                <p>Bounty runes appear on the exact same position every single time in a five minute interval. Bounties give extra gold to everyone in the team, independent from the player who picks it up. With every interval the gold amount increases. In long games the bounties can reach extreme amounts of gold.</p>
            </div>
    
            <div>
                <h3>Power-Up Runes</h3>
                <p>The power-up runes randomly appear on one of the two river positions in a two minute interval. Power-up runes have six types of runes: The Invisibility Rune, Illusion Rune, Double Damage Rune, Arcane Rune, Haste Rune, and Regeneration Rune.</p>
            </div>
    
            <div>
                <h3>Jungle, Creeps, and Roshan</h3>
                <p>On the Dota 2 map the jungle is between the lanes and is an extra area to creep and get more xp.
                In the jungle, neutral creeps spots spawn in an interval of one minute. The first neutral creeps spawn at the 1-minute mark. Creep spots can be blocked if a ward is placed or a hero is too near but also can be doubled by the method of stacking and pulling.
                
                In the river cave is the strongest neutral creep: Roshan the Immortal. He is extremely powerful and normally you need the full team to bring him down. Taking down Roshan takes time and the enemy team should prevent this and react fast. When Roshan is taken down, crucial items are dropped like the Aegis of the Immortal, which revives one hero instantly. Later on more items get dropped like Cheese, Refresher Shard or Aghanims Blessing.</p>

            <h1>Controls</h1>
            <div>
                <h3>Unit Controls</h3>
                <p>Left Click allows unit selection. Clicking on a unit selects it and displays its information. If the unit is uncontrollable, attempting to issue a command will deselect it and reselect the last unit you had controlled.</p>
    
                <p>Left Click + Drag creates a selection box. All of the player's controllable units within the box get selected.</p>
            
                <p>Right Click commands selected units to the move to the targeted point. If Right Click is used on an enemy, the units will be commanded to attack that enemy. Right Click on an ally will simply command to follow that ally. If the Force Right-Click Attack option is enabled, it will command the selected unit to deny that ally if available.</p>
            
                <p>Holding Shift while issuing commands will que the commands. In unit selection, Shift + Left Click on an allied unit will add it to your selection. Shift + Left Click on an already selected unit removes the unit from your selection.</p>
    
                <p>The Ctrl key is used for several purposes. If Unified Unit Orders is enabled, Ctrl held down plus Left Click or Right Click will command all controllable units to follow that click's command regardless of your current selection. Holding Ctrl and the corresponding Hotkey will level up an ability if a skill point is available. Holding Ctrl can also be used on a few items to modify their targeting.</p>
            </div>

                <h3>Shop Controls</h3>
                <p>Right Click on an item to purchase it. If the player does not have enough gold or is too far from a shop, the item will not be bought. If the item can be bought from the Home Shop, it will be bought and then go into the player's Stash at base. </p>
                <p>Left Click on an item to display all related items. The items that make up its component parts are displayed underneath, while items that can be completed with it are displayed above.</p>
