        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed and published by Valve. The game is a sequel to Defense of the Ancients (DotA), which was a community-created mod for Blizzard Entertainment's Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos. Dota 2 is played in matches between two teams of five players, with each team occupying and defending their own separate base on the map. Each of the ten players independently controls a powerful character, known as a "hero", who all have unique abilities and differing styles of play. During a match players collect experience points and items for their heroes to successfully defeat the opposing team's heroes in player versus player combat. A team wins by being the first to destroy the other team's "Ancient", a large structure located within their base.</p>

        <h1>Unit Controls</h1>
        <li>
        Left Click allows unit selection. Clicking on a unit selects it and displays its information. If the unit is uncontrollable, attempting to issue a command will deselect it and reselect the last unit you had controlled.
        </li>

        <li>Left Click + Drag creates a selection box. All of the player's controllable units within the box get selected.</li>
        
        <li>Right Click commands selected units to the move to the targeted point. If Right Click is used on an enemy, the units will be commanded to attack that enemy. Right Click on an ally will simply command to follow that ally. If the Force Right-Click Attack option is enabled, it will command the selected unit to deny that ally if available.</li>
        
        <li>Holding Shift while issuing commands will que the commands. In unit selection, Shift + Left Click on an allied unit will add it to your selection. Shift + Left Click on an already selected unit removes the unit from your selection.</li>
        
        <li>The Ctrl key is used for several purposes. If Unified Unit Orders is enabled, Ctrl held down plus Left Click or Right Click will command all controllable units to follow that click's command regardless of your current selection. Holding Ctrl and the corresponding Hotkey will level up an ability if a skill point is available. Holding Ctrl can also be used on a few items to modify their targeting.</li>
